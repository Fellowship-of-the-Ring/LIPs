This is the suggested template for new LIPs.

Note that a LIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your LIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `lip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

## Preamble

    LIP: <to be assigned>
    Title: <LIP title>
    Author: <list of authors' names and optionally, email addresses>
    Module (*only required for Standard Track): <Contract | Wallet | Relayer | RingMiner |JSLib> 
    Status: Draft
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
    Requires (*optional): <LIP number(s)>
    Replaces (*optional): <LIP number(s)>


## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for LIPs that want to change the Loopring protocol. LIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any LIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
